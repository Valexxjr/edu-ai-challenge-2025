I will provide you with a code snippet for a function named processUserData. Your task is to perform an in-depth, expert-level analysis of this code from three distinct professional perspectives. Please review the code sequentially as each of the following roles:

Experienced Developer
Focus on: code readability, maintainability, logic clarity, error handling, best practices, and potential refactoring opportunities.
Provide: specific recommendations, stylistic or architectural improvements, and observations about how well the code adheres to general software engineering principles.

Security Engineer
Focus on: identifying any potential security vulnerabilities, data handling risks (e.g., sensitive information exposure, injection risks), authentication/authorization assumptions, and compliance concerns (e.g., GDPR, OWASP).
Provide: clear explanations of the risk, practical fixes, and how to better secure the function.

Performance Specialist
Focus on: execution efficiency, resource usage (e.g., memory, CPU), scalability, and any bottlenecks or unnecessary computations.
Provide: performance metrics (if inferable), profiling advice, and optimizations or algorithmic alternatives where relevant.

Instructions:
Perform each analysis independently, clearly labeling the role and section (e.g., "üîç Developer Review", "üîí Security Review", "‚öôÔ∏è Performance Review").
Be as specific and actionable as possible. Avoid generic feedback unless it's directly applicable to the code.
Do not skip any role or merge their perspectives.

Input Code:
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public List<Map<String, Object>> processUserData(List<Map<String, Object>> data) {
    List<Map<String, Object>> users = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
        Map<String, Object> user = new HashMap<>();
        user.put("id", data.get(i).get("id"));
        user.put("name", data.get(i).get("name"));
        user.put("email", data.get(i).get("email"));
        user.put("active", data.get(i).get("status").equals("active") ? true : false);
        users.add(user);
    }
    
    System.out.println("Processed " + users.size() + " users");
    
    return users;
}

public boolean saveToDatabase(List<Map<String, Object>> users) {
    // TODO: Implement database connection
    boolean success = true;
    return success;
}
