Let's walk through this step-by-step to identify the most suitable type of database for your social platform.

Step 1: Identify the Data Types and Access Patterns
You need to store:

User profiles – structured data with attributes (e.g. name, age, bio)

Posts – semi-structured or structured content with metadata (text, timestamps, media references)

Connections between users – highly interconnected data (follows, likes, friendships)

Your operations include:

80% reads, such as fetching user feeds, profiles, connections

20% writes, like creating posts, updating profiles, adding connections

Step 2: Consider the Key Requirements
High read performance – crucial for responsiveness

Scalability – millions of users = high throughput, horizontal scalability

Relationship-heavy data – user connections, post likes, follows

Flexible schema – user profiles and posts may evolve over time

Step 3: Evaluate Database Types
Database Type	Strengths	Weaknesses	Suitability
Relational (RDBMS)	Strong consistency, ACID	Hard to scale horizontally, joins can be expensive	✅ for profiles and posts, ❌ for relationships
Document (e.g., MongoDB)	Schema flexibility, good for semi-structured data	Weaker in relationship querying	✅ for profiles and posts, ❌ for user connections
Key-Value (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)	High-speed lookups, scalable	Poor at complex relationships	✅ for caching reads, ❌ as primary store
Wide-Column (e.g., Cassandra)	Scalable, fast reads/writes	Limited relationship querying	✅ for time-series posts, ❌ for connections
Graph (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)	Best for complex relationships, fast traversal	Less efficient for bulk content storage	✅ for user connections, ❌ for storing large content

Step 4: Propose an Architecture Using Polyglot Persistence
No single database type satisfies all needs perfectly. The most scalable and flexible solution is a polyglot persistence architecture:

Document Database (e.g., MongoDB or Couchbase)
🔹 Use for user profiles and posts
🔹 Handles semi-structured data, good read performance, and easy scaling

Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j or Amazon Neptune)
🔹 Use for modeling user relationships and interactions
🔹 Optimized for traversals (e.g., mutual friends, followers-of-followers)

Optional: In-Memory Cache (e.g., Redis)
🔹 Use for speeding up hot reads (popular posts, trending users)

Step 5: Final Recommendation
Given your constraints:

High scalability

High read performance

Rich relationship modeling

✅ Primary data stores:

MongoDB for profiles and posts

Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for user connections

✅ Optional enhancement:

Redis for read-heavy caching layer

This combination balances performance, scalability, and data modeling needs.
