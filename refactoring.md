# Battleship Game Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the refactoring changes made to the Battleship game implementation to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage.

## Major Changes

### 1. Code Structure Improvements
- Implemented proper module organization with clear separation of concerns
- Created dedicated modules for different components:
  - `models/` - Core game entities (Board, Ship, Player)
  - `game/` - Game logic and management
  - `display/` - User interface and display management
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and input handling

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- Added comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Implemented test fixtures and mocks for isolated testing
- Created test cases for all major components:
  - Board functionality
  - Ship placement and management
  - Player moves and game logic
  - Game manager operations

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Added type hints for better code documentation
- Implemented proper error handling
- Improved code readability with consistent formatting
- Added docstrings and comments for better code documentation

### 4. Game Logic Enhancements
- Improved ship placement validation
- Enhanced game state management
- Better handling of player and CPU moves
- More robust win condition checking

## Test Coverage
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the game's functionality, including:
- Board initialization and management
- Ship placement and validation
- Player and CPU move handling
- Game state management
- Win condition checking

## Future Improvements
1. Add more edge case testing
2. Implement additional game features
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback
4. Improve CPU player strategy

## Conclusion
The refactoring has resulted in a more maintainable, testable, and robust implementation of the Battleship game. The code is now better organized, more thoroughly tested, and easier to extend with new features.
