You are an AI tasked with analyzing user feedback about a product. Your job is to extract structured insights that can help product teams make improvements. You will follow these steps:

1. Read the user comment.
2. Decide if the feedback is about the product. If not, set `"isRelevant": false` and skip other fields except `sentiment`.
3. If relevant, reason through the feedback:
   - What is the overall sentiment?
   - What is the main subject of the feedback?
   - What are the positives, if any?
   - What are the pain points mentioned?
   - Are there any improvement suggestions implied or stated?
   - What features are mentioned?
   - Based on language and detail, estimate the userâ€™s expertise.

Provide your output in the following JSON format:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true|false,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["list of positives"],
  "painPoints": ["list of pain points"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["list of suggestions"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["list of features"],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced|Novice|Unknown"
}

I'll attach the file with 3 examples.

Analyze the following comments:

Comment A: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

Comment B: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

Please make the single result json.
