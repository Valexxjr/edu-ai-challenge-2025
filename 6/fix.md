# Enigma Machine Bug Fix Documentation

## Bug Description

The original implementation of the Enigma machine had an incorrect rotor stepping mechanism, which is a critical component of the encryption process. The bug was located in the `stepRotors()` method of the `Enigma` class.

### Original Implementation Issues:
1. The stepping logic did not properly implement the double-stepping mechanism
2. The order of checking rotor notches was incorrect
3. The conditions for stepping rotors were not properly nested

### Impact:
- Incorrect rotor stepping led to improper encryption/decryption
- Messages encrypted and then decrypted with the same settings would not return to their original form
- The machine did not accurately simulate the historical Enigma behavior

## Fix Implementation

The fix involved restructuring the `stepRotors()` method to properly implement the Enigma's stepping mechanism:

```javascript
stepRotors() {
    // Check if middle rotor is at notch position
    if (this.rotors[1].atNotch()) {
        this.rotors[0].step(); // Step left rotor
        this.rotors[1].step(); // Step middle rotor
    }
    // Check if right rotor is at notch position
    else if (this.rotors[2].atNotch()) {
        this.rotors[1].step(); // Step middle rotor
    }
    this.rotors[2].step(); // Always step right rotor
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. Properly implemented the double-stepping mechanism
2. Corrected the order of notch checking (middle rotor first, then right rotor)
3. Added proper conditional logic to handle rotor stepping

## Verification

The fix was verified through a comprehensive test suite that checks:
1. Basic encryption/decryption functionality
2. Operation with plugboard connections
3. Behavior with different rotor positions

All tests confirm that the machine now correctly:
- Encrypts and decrypts messages
- Maintains proper rotor stepping
- Handles plugboard connections
- Works with various rotor positions
