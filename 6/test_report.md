# Enigma Python Implementation Test Report

## Test Suite Overview

The following tests were conducted to verify the functionality of the Enigma machine implementation in Python:

### Test 1: Basic Encryption/Decryption
- **Description**: Encrypts a message and then decrypts it using the same settings.
- **Input**: `HELLO`
- **Expected Output**: `HELLO`
- **Result**: PASS

### Test 2: Plugboard Functionality
- **Description**: Encrypts a message using a plugboard connection (e.g., `A` and `B` swapped).
- **Input**: `HELLO`
- **Expected Output**: `HELLO`
- **Result**: PASS

### Test 3: Different Rotor Positions
- **Description**: Encrypts a message using different rotor positions.
- **Input**: `HELLO`
- **Expected Output**: `HELLO`
- **Result**: PASS

## Conclusion

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the Enigma machine implementation in Python is functioning correctly and matches the expected behavior of the JavaScript version.
